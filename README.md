### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 #My name is Alexey, I entered the Peter the Great Polytechnic University to major in radio engineering, I am interested in football, chess, and I adore sports and theater. I studied at theater school for 9 years, received a clean certificate, after which I spent another 2 years unofficially studying theater and playing a big role in a long-running play.
